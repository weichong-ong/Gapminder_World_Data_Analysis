## Introduction
**Gapminder Dataset:** Gapminder Foundation is a non-profit venture registered in Stockholm, Sweden, that promotes sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels. Gapminder collaborates with universities, UN, public agencies and non-governmental organizations to collect information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. Gapminder's stated mission is 'Fighting devastating ignorance with fact-based worldviews everyone can understand.'

**Motivation:** I read the book Factfullness by Hans Rosling and I found it very fascinating and felt ashamed at the same time about my ignorance about the world. I got most of the 13 fact questions in the book wrong. Hans Rosling claimed that the majority of people scored worse than chimpanzees (worse than random). In order to find the answers myself, I decided to do the analysis using the data provided by Gapminder. For this project, I investigated four indicators which are population, age, income and life expectancy and analyzed the relationships between indicators.

This project will explore the following questions:
1. How did the world population change over time?
2. What would be the world population by different age group in the future?
3. Where does the majority of the world population live today?
4. What are the top 10 most populous countries today?
5. How did the life expectancy change over time?
6. What is the life expectancy vs income per person of the world by continent today?

## Summary and Conclusion
* There is an overall upward trend for the world population, the income per person and the life expectancy.
* The world population is increasing rapidly is because of the increasing number of adults. The number of children remained almost constant for the last 50 years and will stay the same in the future.
* Income per person and life expectancy are correclated. People live longer in richer countries and the average length of life of people in poorer countries is relatively shorter. Nevertheless, there is still a huge difference in life expectancy between countries on the same income level.
